# PILLARS OF OOP

- Additional features that explain the why (and how) particular classes can interact 
with eachother within an object oriented language.
- Heavily intergrated with classes
- Four. Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inhereitance, Encapsulation. (APIE)

## Encapsulation
- Being able to bundle loads of variables together under the umbrella of an object
- The abilities to create classes that encapsulate many different variable as properties of an object
- The ability to choose which properties and methods are being displayed to the public
- Think class creation and object instantiating!!

## Abstraction
- The ability to 'boil' a class down to its most basic components
- The act of 'generalizing' a class to be reused as a base for other classes
- Taking similarities from multiple classes and putting them in a new class that the others are derived from
- There are a few different ways to abstract
- Classes, Abstract Classes, Interfaces

## Inheritance 
- The act of taking properties and methods from a parent class or interface and using them as your own
- The other side of abstraction
- There are a few different ways to inherit

##Polymorphism
- The Idea that children can act as their parents when needed.
- Many forms (an object can take on different typings dependent on parent classes)
